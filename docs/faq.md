## Why should I use Package-Sets over normal Psc-Package?

First, make sure to read the short explanation of Psc-Package: <https://package-sets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html>

Then read the explanation of why and how Dhall is used: <https://package-sets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/why-dhall.html>

In short, because package sets are annoying to edit when they're only in JSON form, but using Dhall can make working with this information much easier.
