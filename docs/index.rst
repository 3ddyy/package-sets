Package-Sets Guide aka "Spacchetti"
============================

This is a guide for the Package Set project `Package-Sets <https://github.com/purescript/package-sets>`_, which provides a way to work with package definitions for Psc-Package using the `Dhall <https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-lang>`_ programming language. This guide will also try to guide you through some of the details of how Psc-Package itself works, and some details about the setup of this project and how to use Dhall.

Historically, this was a separate project created by Justin Woo called "Spacchetti" (as in Spagghetti + Pacchetti). This has now merged into package-sets, but is still referred to as "Spacchetti" in many resources.

.. note:: If there is a topic you would like more help with that is not in this guide, open a issue in the Github repo for it to request it.
